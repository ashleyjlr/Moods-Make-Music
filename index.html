  <h1 id="main-title">Moods Make Music</h1>
	<h2 id="slogan">sometimes we can't find the words to express how we feel, so let us find the songs to do just that.</h2>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>Mental health impacts almost every aspect of our lives, which is why it is important to keep up with our moods. Although there are endless complex emotions we feel in our day to day lives, they all ultimately fall under these categories: Happy, Sad, Angry, or Tired. Many researchers claim that music has the ability to boost moods in addition to many other stress-alleviating benefits. Even sad music can lift your mood! So sit back, enjoy, and let the music take control <3</p>
